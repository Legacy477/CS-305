The company we were doing this project for was Artemis Insurance, The project was to get access to the files given to us and then run several tests on their code adding in several security measures. Not only that but creating a certificate, as well as running dependency cheks allowing us to see the faults in there system and fix them.
I would say i0n terms of things I did well would probably be assessing the dependency check and reducing all the false checks this was a simple process even though it took a while. The reason its important to check the codes securityt is because someone could have access to everything within the company by accessin gthe code. They could also have the ability to steal code from a company that worked hard to create what they have.
Setting up the initial code and running the verification and dependency check was the easy part but when I was fixing them it took a really long time so it wasn't really hard but tedious. 
In terms of layering security To enhance security, a multi-layered approach is essential, incorporating strategies like defense in depth, regular audits, user awareness training, and robust access controls. Future vulnerability assessments should involve tools like vulnerability scanners, penetration testing, risk assessments, and threat modeling to prioritize and address weaknesses. Techniques like Zero Trust, patch management, and threat intelligence will play key roles in reducing exposure. As the threat landscape evolves, leveraging AI and machine learning for anomaly detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, and blockchain for data integrity will be critical for maintaining resilient security. Regular monitoring, incident response plans, and continuous improvement ensure organizations stay prepared against emerging threats.
After adding i the refactored code I was able to rerun the test so that there weren't any new vulnerabilities that I ran into.
FOr future employers, I would probably say that this taught me to be able to effectively asses the vulnerabilities in the code base allowing for an overall healthier code.
